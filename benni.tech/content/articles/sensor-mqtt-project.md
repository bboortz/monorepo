I had some issues with my heating. Also an technition had no luck. The path forward was unclear.. I am not a technition for heatings, I am an IT guys. So what is obvious? To monitor the "performance" of my heating in order to track the issue and try to fix it. 
What I can say it was a full success. I would call the solution with my heating a patch and it is clear that I need a new one.

This article is not about the problem of my heating as itself it a about a idea. I want to collect data from our house like heating, solar, power consumption, etc. For the heating I already have a use case for the parts right now not.

But how does my current solution for the monitoring of my heating look like.
