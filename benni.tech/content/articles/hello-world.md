Welcome to my **awesome** new blog everyone! This is my first blog post.
I have decided to run this blog on decentralized infrastructure and have choosen to deploy My blog [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) using [Fleek](https://fleek.co) and [Hugo](https://http://gohugo.io/).
In the next weeks I am planning to write about the learnings I will do about running a blog that runs on decentralized infrastructure.
